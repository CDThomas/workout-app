# Notes

## Todo
- [x] simple seed exercises
- [x] simple exercise list UI
- [x] add eslint
- [x] basic style improvements for UI (think Product Hunt)
  - Might use CSS modules (can reference ducker webpack config)
- [x] placeholder for exercise thumbnail in UI
- [x] add main muscle worked to exercises
  - this is simpler than going with muscles targeted (many to many)
  - starting here and can change later if I really need to support multiple (start simple and
    move to complex)
  - changed from enum to a one-to-many association
- [x] serialize data for the FE
  - Because snake case in JS annoys me and leads to inconsitency/bugs. And the linter yells at me.
  - And because exercise names have underscores in them (like lower_back)
- [x] add search to exercises
  - [x] API get endpoint that supports query param
  - [x] search UI
- [x] user can create new exercises
  - I'm thinking there should be an "add new" button that pulls up a modal
  - This lets the user stay in the context of creating the routine (don't have to leave the routine
    creation page to add new exercises for that routine)
  - [x] form in UI
    - will need to load muscle group options from BE
  - [x] API endpoints
    - [x] POST /exercises
    - [x] GET /muscles
- [x] search on `main_mucle_worked` as well as `name`
- [x] Handle empty list state in ExercisePanel
- [x] user can create routines
  - [x] add routines and sets to db/models
  - [x] click exercise on left to add to end of exercises on right
- [x] Better error handling
  - Something similar to: https://react.semantic-ui.com/collections/message#message-example-error
- [x] add authentication
  - [x] [Knock](https://github.com/nsarno/knock) looks like a good start. Can roll my own later if I want.
  - [x] Login page
  - [x] Logout link
  - [x] protected routes
- [ ] client-side validation of forms/inputs with feedback for user
- [ ] ErrorMessage component
- [ ] user can remove an exercise in the RoutineExerciseList
- [ ] try using JSON schemas for validation (ex: in POST to routines#create)
  - I think this would be cleaner than `accepts_nested_attributes_for` because the FE can send nicely
    formatted JSON without using rails conventions
    - specifically, `{ "fafSetsAttributes": { ... } }` is awkward
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop support
  - [ ] drag exercise from list to place in order in sets on right
  - [ ] drag and drop sets to change order
- [ ] something to make it more obvious that the newly created exercise is at the top of the list
      would be helpful. Maybe animate it or highlight it?
  - sliding the new exercise in after the modal has closed sounds like a good option
  - or I could just apply a generally animation to the list for things being added/removed, and this
    could handle itself. The only other time this animation would fire is during search though.
- [ ] Add tests for more than just models
- [ ] paginate exercises
  - [ ] pagination BE
  - [ ] pagination FE (infinate scroll or "load more")
- [ ] user can edit exercises
- [ ] animate search on the exercise list? eh?
- [ ] animate Message component entering dom
  - https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html
- [ ] user can view routines they have created
- [ ] user can edit routines
- [ ] add images to exercises
  - I'm thinking google cloud storage because it'd be free
  - can use carrierwave/fog
  - or paperclip/fog
  - or cloudinary
- [ ] exercise details component
  - I'm thinking a modal (like how Product Hunt's product details work)
  - Details could include instructions, your performances/history, etc
- [ ] webpack optimization stuff
  - lodash
- [ ] add autoprefixer
- [ ] Could show user names of similar exercises that have been created while creating an exercise
- [ ] Favicon
- [ ] prevent scrolling on parent elements (document body) when ExercisePanel reaches its boundaries
  - Can terribly hackily toggle `overflow: hidden` on `document.body` on mouse enter/leave
  - can do something like on of these in a HOC
    - http://jsbin.com/itajok/539/edit?html,js,output (best looking so far)

    - https://dimakuzmich.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/prevent-scrolling-of-parent-element-with-javascript/
- readme
  - [ ] .env
  - [ ] startup
  - [ ] deployment
- draft routines?
- TODO's anywhere in code
