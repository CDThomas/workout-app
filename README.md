## Structure

Still deciding how to handle this for the React app (in `/client`).

Right now it's organized mostly by file type:
```
src/
  components/
  config/
  helpers/
  pages/
  startup/
```

The exception to this is style files, which are co-located with the component that they apply to.
I like co-location, so I might organize files by feature after the app grows.

For reference when I revisit this, it could look like:

```
src/
  Main/
    components/
      NavBar/
    index.js
    rootReducer.js
    styles.css
  RoutineFinder/
    index.js
    actions.js
    reducers.js
    styles.css
  RoutineEditor/
    ExercisePanel/
    SetList/
    index.js
    styles.css
  Login/
  shared/
    Title/
    Modal/
    Button/
    ...
```
