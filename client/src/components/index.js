/*
  I'm exporting components from an index file as described here:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34072598/es6-exporting-importing-in-index-file .

  Along with changing `resolve.modules` in webpack.config.js, this allow for nice file path
  resolution for imports. See: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-modules

  Example import:
  `import { Button } from 'components'`

export { default as AppMain } from './AppMain/AppMain'
export { default as Button } from './Button/Button'
export { default as ConfirmDialog } from './ConfirmDialog/ConfirmDialog'
export { default as ExercisePanel } from './ExercisePanel/ExercisePanel'
export { default as Field } from './Field/Field'
export { default as PageHeader } from './PageHeader/PageHeader'
export { default as Heading } from './Heading/Heading'
