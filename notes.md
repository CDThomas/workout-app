# Notes

## Todo
- [x] simple seed exercises
- [x] simple exercise list UI
- [x] add eslint
- [ ] basic style improvements for UI (think Product Hunt)
  - Might use CSS modules (can reference ducker webpack config)
- [ ] add muscles targeted to Exercise
- [ ] add authentication
  - [Knock](https://github.com/nsarno/knock) looks like a good start. Can roll my own later if I want.
