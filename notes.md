# Notes

## Todo
- [x] simple seed exercises
- [x] simple exercise list UI
- [x] add eslint
- [x] basic style improvements for UI (think Product Hunt)
  - Might use CSS modules (can reference ducker webpack config)
- [x] placeholder for exercise thumbnail in UI
- [ ] add muscles targeted to Exercise
- [ ] add authentication
  - [Knock](https://github.com/nsarno/knock) looks like a good start. Can roll my own later if I want.

- [ ] click exercise on left to add to sets on right
- [ ] drag and drop sets
